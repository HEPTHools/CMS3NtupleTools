# NtupleMaker

There are only three branches now!
  - master: **all tags should be tags of the master; the master should always run**
  - before2015deletions: old version of the master, has a bunch of stuff that was deleted in early 2015
  - V05-03-32: most up-to-date version of code that was used for 8 TeV stuff
  
For development: make a new branch, test your changes, then merge with master **and delete the branch**.  Unattended branches may be deleted by admin.
  
See twiki for instructions about how to use all this to make nTuples.  Short answer: see README in cmstas/NtupleTools/AutoTupler
